"The purpose of this experiment is to measure how initially disturbing an area and adding nitrogen over a long time will affect the number of species, the type of species present, the amount of annual growth, and the change from year to year in the growth of each species in a plant community which is also relieved of grazing by large and small mammals. This experiment is conducted within fields (A, B, and C) which were initially low in soil nutrients. The ground was disturbed by thoroughly disking the area prior to establishment of the experiment. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. There are six replicates of each treatment per field. The treatments were randomly assigned to plots of size 4 by 4 meters. The plots are in 6 plot by 9 plot grids with 1 meter aisles between plots. The plot grids are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. In the spring of 1992, subexperiments E097 and E098 were established. E097 is in fields A and C where randomly selected plots within each treatment no longer receive fertilizer. E098 is in field B where randomly selected plots within each treatment are burned. Note that the design of E002 is similar to E001 except E002 was thoroughly disked prior to establishment.",David Tilman,urn:node:LTER,Tilman,1982-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,"uid=CDR\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org",6749820d30cec642b5b85aef3b879717,MD5,,,urn:node:LTER,https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/doi%3A10.6073%2FAA%2Fknb-lter-cdr.157002.122,2012-06-26T15:12:06.971Z,2012-04-24T00:00:00Z,2012-03-12T23:00:00Z,,,-93.16289,,2009-01-01T00:00:00Z,,https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/doi%3A10.6073%2FAA%2Fknb-lter-cdr.157002.122,eml://ecoinformatics.org/eml-2.1.0,METADATA,,,,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-cdr.157002.122,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-cdr.157002.122,Tilman,,true,,,"carbon,ecology,ecosystems,nitrogen,nutrients,soil,species",,,,,45.44138,,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-cdr.157002.123,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-cdr.157002.121,,,David Tilman,,,,,,,,2012-04-24T00:00:00Z,,"public,uid=CDR\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org",,"urn:node:LTER,urn:node:CN",false,"2012-06-26T00:00:00Z,2012-06-26T00:00:00Z",,"uid=CDR,o=LTER,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org",,,,11138,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-cdr.157002.122,,45.384865,,"uid=CDR,o=LTER,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org",,Soil carbon,,2012-03-12T23:00:00Z,,-93.22445,"uid=CDR\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org"

"Process-based models of plant litter decomposition typically underestimate the rates of decomposition in arid and semi-arid grasslands. Recent research, including our field studies, suggests that photodegradation, the decomposition of material through solar radiation, may play an important role in arid and semi-arid grassland ecosystems. The contribution of photodegradation to overall rates of decomposition is not well understood or quantified. The goal of this project is to investigate the effects of ultraviolet radiation on rates of plant litter decomposition for two grass species, Andropogon gerardii and Bouteloua gracilis, in three grassland sites: Cedar Creek (MN), Shortgrass Steppe (CO), and Sevilleta (NM).",Leslie Brandt,urn:node:LTER,Brandt,2006-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,"uid=CDR\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org",a916ca856694b6ffab85236706b9ac98,MD5,,,urn:node:LTER,https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/doi%3A10.6073%2FAA%2Fknb-lter-cdr.166219.122,2013-03-08T16:53:40.334Z,2012-04-24T00:00:00Z,2012-05-06T23:00:00Z,,,-93.16289,,2008-01-01T00:00:00Z,,https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/doi%3A10.6073%2FAA%2Fknb-lter-cdr.166219.122,eml://ecoinformatics.org/eml-2.1.0,METADATA,,,,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-cdr.166219.122,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-cdr.166219.122,Brandt,,true,,,"ecology,ecosystems,grasses,grasslands,litter,litter decomposition,radiation,species",,,,,45.44138,,knb-lter-cdr.166219.123,,,,Leslie Brandt,,,,,,,,2012-04-24T00:00:00Z,,"public,uid=CDR\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org",,"urn:node:LTER,urn:node:CN",false,"2012-06-26T00:00:00Z,2012-06-26T00:00:00Z",,"uid=CDR,o=LTER,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org",,,,12574,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-cdr.166219.122,,45.384865,,"uid=CDR,o=LTER,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org",,UV Litter Decomposition,,2012-05-06T23:00:00Z,,-93.22445,"uid=CDR\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org"
"A quadrat survey was conducted in October 2003 to measure the species and size distribution of plants at 10 GCE LTER sampling sites.  The quadrats were established as permanent plots at GCE sampling sites in October 2000 by placing wooden stakes at random locations across two nominal zones at each site, designated based on marsh structure (creekbank and high marsh).  Several new plots were also added in October 2001, 2002 and 2003 to replace those lost due to catastrophic wrack disturbance or creek bank erosion.  The plots were visually surveyed and the species, shoot height, and flowering status was recorded individually for each shoot over 10 cm in height present in each plot.  Observations from plots exhibiting signs of disturbance were noted in the data set.  This survey will be repeated annually to assess changes in plant distribution and biomass in relation to environmental changes documented by other GCE LTER monitoring efforts.",Steven C.

"Permanent plots are a powerful tool for understanding systems over the long term because of the rigorous quantification of patterns in a spatially refined way and because of the comparability of numerous variables measured in the same place. In 1998, 7 plots were surveyed into 3 forests in the study region of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES): Oregon Ridge Park (4 plots), Hillsdale Park (1 plot), and Leakin Park (2 plots). Plots were surveyed in to correct for slope and to achieve an accuracy of plot side length to within 0.5 cm. Plots are 1600 m2 with the exception of the Hillsdale plot which is 900 m2. The Hillsdale plot is smaller to fit within the confines of the forest patch. Sites were selected 1) to represent urban and non-urban forests, 2) away from obvious habitat boundaries or edges, 3) with consistent drainage lines within the plot, and 4) with at least 80 % continuous tree canopy. All vegetation layers were sampled in order to characterize the structure and composition of the plant community. A variety of sampling methods were used for the different layers but all layers were quantified with a high level of detail to minimize variation and to best characterize the plot.","M. L.

"Permanent plots are a powerful tool for understanding systems over the long term because of the rigorous quantification of patterns in a spatially refined way and because of the comparability of numerous variables measured in the same place. In 1998, 7 plots were surveyed into 3 forests in the study region of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES): Oregon Ridge Park (4 plots), Hillsdale Park (1 plot), and Leakin Park (2 plots). Plots were surveyed in to correct for slope and to achieve an accuracy of plot side length to within 0.5 cm. Plots are 1600 m2 with the exception of the Hillsdale plot which is 900 m2. The Hillsdale plot is smaller to fit within the confines of the forest patch. Sites were selected 1) to represent urban and non-urban forests, 2) away from obvious habitat boundaries or edges, 3) with consistent drainage lines within the plot, and 4) with at least 80 % continuous tree canopy. All vegetation layers were sampled in order to characterize the structure and composition of the plant community. A variety of sampling methods were used for the different layers but all layers were quantified with a high level of detail to minimize variation and to best characterize the plot.","M. L.

"Nitrogen (N) is a limiting nutrient to plant growth in many ecosystems, and human-caused N enrichment has the potential to fundamentally alter the structure and functioning of plant communities.  Nutrient limitation of primary production has been of interest to ecologists for many years, as a result there are many fertilization experiments in diverse community types. A group of Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) network researchers founded PDT-Net (Productivity, Diversity &raits Network), to synthesize datasets from fertilization experiments in herbaceous communities across North America. Although responses to N addition were highly variable, several clear patterns emerged. We found that N addition increased productivity, reduced plant species diversity, and that plant species with particular functional traits (e.g. N-fixation ability, native and annual species) declined with fertilization, while others increased in dominance. Differences among responses of particular species common to several sites, as well as responses of species diversity in general, could be explained by differences in environmental context across sites.  Finally, we found that fertilization altered community structure, by altering the distribution of species rank abundances, and by creating greater spatial heterogeneity.

The dataset archived here contains relative abundances by species for ten sites (and many experiments within those sites) in control and fertilized plots.  Species traits, productivity, and other environmental data are archived separately but link with this dataset.",Elsa Cleland,urn:node:KNB,Cleland,1989-07-01T00:00:00Z,,,,"uid=elsac\,o=unaffiliated\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org,uid=knbadmin\,o=NCEAS\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org,uid=nceasadmin\,o=NCEAS\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org,uid=bowdish\,o=NCEAS\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org",55748496f5cfea3bcfb4b26c3f23b459,MD5,,"NCEAS 9520: Utilizing meta-analysis and structural equation modeling to disentangle the influences of functional traits and environmental context,National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis,NCEAS",urn:node:KNB,https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FAA%2Fknb.192.5,2012-06-14T09:27:23.149Z,,2006-03-09T00:00:00Z,,,-81.0,,2005-07-01T00:00:00Z,,https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FAA%2Fknb.192.5,eml://ecoinformatics.org/eml-2.0.1,METADATA,,,,doi:10.5063/AA/knb.192.5,doi:10.5063/AA/knb.192.5,Cleland,,true,,,"Community ecology,Nitrogen,Fertilization,Relative abundance,Plant,LTER",,,,,68.0,,,doi:10.5063/AA/knb.192.4,,,"NCEAS 9520: Utilizing meta-analysis and structural equation modeling to disentangle the influences of functional traits and environmental context,National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis,Elsa Cleland",,,,,,,,,,"uid=elsac\,o=unaffiliated\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org,public,uid=knbadmin\,o=NCEAS\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org,uid=nceasadmin\,o=NCEAS\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org,uid=bowdish\,o=NCEAS\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org",,"urn:node:KNB,urn:node:CN",false,"2012-06-14T00:00:00Z,2012-06-14T00:00:00Z",,"uid=elsac,o=unaffiliated,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org",,,,13057,doi:10.5063/AA/knb.192.5,,31.0,,"uid=nceasadmin,o=NCEAS,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org",,Synthesis of nitrogen fertilization experiments in North America - plant species relative abundance,,2006-03-09T00:00:00Z,,-143.0,"uid=elsac\,o=unaffiliated\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org,uid=knbadmin\,o=NCEAS\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org,uid=nceasadmin\,o=NCEAS\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org,uid=bowdish\,o=NCEAS\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org"

"This study examines the effects of long-term prescribed burning treatments on vegetation structure and composition, productivity, and nutrient cycling in upland oak savanna and woodland vegetation. The basis for the study is an ongoing, experimental prescribed burning program begun in 1964 at Cedar Creek, and a similar program operating since 1962 on the adjacent Helen Allison Savanna property (owned by The Nature Conservancy). These prescribed burning programs are designed to subject upland oak communities (and some old fields) to different burn frequencies and patterns of burning, with the ultimate objectives of 1) restoring and maintaining the historically important savanna and open woodland vegetation, and 2) providing information about the effects of different burning patterns on vegetation structure and composition. This study addresses the latter of these two purposes and expands on it by also investigating possible influences of fire on resource availability (nutrients, water, and light) and net primary productivity.

"Permanent plots are a powerful tool for understanding systems over the long term because of the rigorous quantification of patterns in a spatially refined way and because of the comparability of numerous variables measured in the same place. In 1998, 7 plots were surveyed into 3 forests in the study region of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES): Oregon Ridge Park (4 plots), Hillsdale Park (1 plot), and Leakin Park (2 plots). Plots were surveyed in to correct for slope and to achieve an accuracy of plot side length to within 0.5 cm. Plots are 1600 m2 with the exception of the Hillsdale plot which is 900 m2. The Hillsdale plot is smaller to fit within the confines of the forest patch. Sites were selected 1) to represent urban and non-urban forests, 2) away from obvious habitat boundaries or edges, 3) with consistent drainage lines within the plot, and 4) with at least 80 % continuous tree canopy. All vegetation layers were sampled in order to characterize the structure and composition of the plant community. A variety of sampling methods were used for the different layers but all layers were quantified with a high level of detail to minimize variation and to best characterize the plot.","M. L.

"A quadrat survey was conducted in October 2006 to measure the species and size distribution of plants at 10 GCE LTER sampling sites. The quadrats were established as permanent plots at GCE sampling sites in October 2000 by placing wooden stakes at random locations across two nominal zones at each site, designated based on marsh structure (creekbank and high marsh). Several new plots were also added in October 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 to replace those lost due to catastrophic wrack disturbance or creek bank erosion. The plots were visually surveyed and the species, shoot height, and flowering status was recorded individually for each shoot over 10 cm in height present in each plot. Observations from plots exhibiting signs of disturbance were noted in the data set. This survey will be repeated annually to assess changes in plant distribution and biomass in relation to environmental changes documented by other GCE LTER monitoring efforts.",Steven C.

"Despite decades of study we have limited insights into the nature of the pre-European landscape of the northeastern USA and the forces and changes that shaped modern forest patterns. Information on such long-term forest dynamics would provide critical insights into the relationships among environmental change, land-use history and biotic responses and is greatly needed for conservation planning. To address these issues we used modern, historical, and paleoecological approaches to reconstruct the 3500-year history of a New England upland region dominated by oak and (formerly) chestnut forests and to interpret the interactions among climate change, natural and human disturbance, and site factors in controlling vegetation patterns and dynamics at different spatial scales. The results indicate that stand, landscape and regional forest dynamics were most strongly driven by climate, notably an apparent cooling and increase in moisture availability c. 1500 yr BP, and European land-use activities commencing 260 yr BP. However, the abundance of oak and chestnut (fire-tolerant, sprouting species) and the distribution of hemlock (fire-intolerant) at a stand to landscape scale were also influenced by fire, which, in turn, varied with climate and human activity. Despite, or perhaps as a consequence of ongoing disturbance by fire and presumably windstorms in this hurricane-prone region, the pre-European period was marked by two 1000+ year periods of remarkably stable forest composition, separated by an abrupt compositional shift. In contrast, over the past 260 years the vegetation has changed rather continuously in response to human activity, producing stand, landscape and regional patterns that are novel ass well as recent in origin. Chestnut was a major component of some pre-European landscapes in New England, in part because of occasional fire, and that cultural and physical factors have interacted over millennia to control vegetation patterns and dynamics. Our analyses also suggest that the composition of low diversity forests can be remarkably stable over millennia.

We briefly outline the environmental history of the Quaternary, discuss the spatial and temporal resolution of the paleoecological evidence for biotic change, and summarize data relevant to such current issues as the nature of the biotic community, the role of disturbance, stability versus rapid change, evolutionary theory, explanations of species diversity, and refugia theory.

"Chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) are found in high densities throughout
the Kruger National Park, one of southern Africa’s leading conservation areas.
Due to their prevalence and relationships to flora and fauna in the park, baboons
play a critical role in shaping Kruger’s ecology. We chose to study time
allocation in order to ascertain the significance of sex, age, and time of day to
behavioral patterns. Activity budgets were determined using focal observations
of male adults, female adults, and juveniles during three periods of the day:
morning, midday, and afternoon. We found that both sex and age affect the
amount of time that an individual spends resting, playing, and being vigilant. In
addition, time of day influences allocation towards eating/foraging, socializing,
resting, and traveling. These results provide a more thorough understanding of
75
the behavior of chacma baboons, a necessary component to developing informed
management policies of Kruger’s complex ecological systems.","Eliza Chamblin, Nick Cuneo, Edie Dooley, Mandy Gibson, Susan Lin, Dr. Cassandra Nunez",urn:node:SANPARKS,"Eliza Chamblin\, Nick Cuneo\, Edie Dooley\, Mandy Gibson\, Susan Lin\, Dr. Cassandra Nunez",,,,,,6188f3629575cd80dc6eb34ceb60605b,MD5,,"SANParks\, South Africa",urn:node:SANPARKS,https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/peggym.1030.1,2012-06-15T03:45:50.643Z,,2009-10-06T00:00:00Z,,,90.0,,,,https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/peggym.1030.1,eml://ecoinformatics.org/eml-2.1.0,METADATA,,,,peggym.1030.1,peggym.1030.1,"Eliza Chamblin\, Nick Cuneo\, Edie Dooley\, Mandy Gibson\, Susan Lin\, Dr. Cassandra Nunez",,true,,,"SANParks\, South Africa,activity budget\, behavioral ecology\, chacma baboons (Papio ursinus)\, sex differences\, Shingwedzi",,,,,45.0,,,,,,"Eliza Chamblin\, Nick Cuneo\, Edie Dooley\, Mandy Gibson\, Susan Lin\, Dr. Cassandra Nunez",,,,,,,,,,"uid=judithk\,o=SANParks\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org,public",,"urn:node:SANPARKS,urn:node:CN",false,"2012-06-15T00:00:00Z,2012-06-15T00:00:00Z",,"uid=peggym,o=SANParks,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org",,,,10897,peggym.1030.1,,-45.0,,"uid=peggym,o=SANParks,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org",,"Sex, Age, and Time Differences in Springtime Activity Budgets of Chacma Baboons (Papio ursinus) in the Kruger National Park",,2009-10-06T00:00:00Z,,-90.0,"uid=judithk\,o=SANParks\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org"

"Permanent plots are a powerful tool for understanding systems over the long term because of the rigorous quantification of patterns in a spatially refined way and because of the comparability of numerous variables measured in the same place. In 1998, 7 plots were surveyed into 3 forests in the study region of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES): Oregon Ridge Park (4 plots), Hillsdale Park (1 plot), and Leakin Park (2 plots). Plots were surveyed in to correct for slope and to achieve an accuracy of plot side length to within 0.5 cm. Plots are 1600 m2 with the exception of the Hillsdale plot which is 900 m2. The Hillsdale plot is smaller to fit within the confines of the forest patch. Sites were selected 1) to represent urban and non-urban forests, 2) away from obvious habitat boundaries or edges, 3) with consistent drainage lines within the plot, and 4) with at least 80 % continuous tree canopy. All vegetation layers were sampled in order to characterize the structure and composition of the plant community. A variety of sampling methods were used for the different layers but all layers were quantified with a high level of detail to minimize variation and to best characterize the plot.","M. L.

"Climate changes forecast for our region by GCM's and shifts in biodiversity and composition each have the potential to alter ecosystem functioning; their interactive effects are unknown. The ""BAC"" experiment is designed to determine the direct and interactive effects of plant species numbers, plant community composition, temperature, and precipitation on 11 productivity, C and N dynamics, stability, and plant, microbe, and insect species abundances in CDR grassland ecosystems. 
 
The experiment uses a subset of 42 plots from the Biodiversity experiment: 14 monoculture plots (one randomly chosen replicate for each of the 14 non-woody species that became well established in monoculture), 14 plots planted to 4 species (randomly chosen from 4-species plots planted with combination of these 14 species), and 14 plots planted to 16 species (randomly chosen from all 16 species plots containing these 14 species). Plant species are from 4 different functional groups (4 species, each, of C3 grasses, C4 grasses, legumes and non-legume forbs) that are likely to respond differently to changes in temperature and water availability. Treatments, to be applied to 4 subplots (3 m x 4 m each) within each of these 42 plots, will create conditions that are (a) warmer than ambient, (b) warmer and watered, (c) ambient temperature but watered, and (d) un-warmed and un-watered, i.e., a full factorial of ambient or elevated temperature and of ambient or elevated precipitation. Temperature will be increased using infrared heat lamps (DeValpine and Harte 2001, Kimball 2005), and increased precipitation using automatic sprinklers; both methods were tested and refined in 2005.",David Tilman,urn:node:LTER,Tilman,2009-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,"uid=CDR\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org",3c589bda5c5ae676fc2095028209cf99,MD5,,,urn:node:LTER,https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/knb-lter-cdr.82249.123,2012-07-05T21:21:13.787Z,2012-07-03T00:00:00Z,2012-03-12T23:00:00Z,,,-93.16289,,2010-01-01T00:00:00Z,,https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/knb-lter-cdr.82249.123,eml://ecoinformatics.org/eml-2.1.0,METADATA,,,,knb-lter-cdr.82249.123,knb-lter-cdr.82249.123,Tilman,,true,,,"diversity,ecology,ecosystems,precipitation,roots,species,temperature,water",,,,,45.44138,,,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-cdr.82249.122,,,David Tilman,,,,,,,,2012-07-03T00:00:00Z,,"public,uid=CDR\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org",,"urn:node:LTER,urn:node:CN",false,"2012-07-05T00:00:00Z,2012-07-05T00:00:00Z",,"uid=CDR,o=LTER,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org",,,,9493,knb-lter-cdr.82249.123,,45.384865,,"uid=CDR,o=LTER,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org",,Root biomass data: BAC: Biodiversity and Climate,,2012-03-12T23:00:00Z,,-93.22445,"uid=CDR\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org"

"Permanent plots are a powerful tool for understanding systems over the long term because of the rigorous quantification of patterns in a spatially refined way and because of the comparability of numerous variables measured in the same place. In 1998, 7 plots were surveyed into 3 forests in the study region of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES): Oregon Ridge Park (4 plots), Hillsdale Park (1 plot), and Leakin Park (2 plots). Plots were surveyed in to correct for slope and to achieve an accuracy of plot side length to within 0.5 cm. Plots are 1600 m2 with the exception of the Hillsdale plot which is 900 m2. The Hillsdale plot is smaller to fit within the confines of the forest patch. Sites were selected 1) to represent urban and non-urban forests, 2) away from obvious habitat boundaries or edges, 3) with consistent drainage lines within the plot, and 4) with at least 80 % continuous tree canopy. All vegetation layers were sampled in order to characterize the structure and composition of the plant community. A variety of sampling methods were used for the different layers but all layers were quantified with a high level of detail to minimize variation and to best characterize the plot.","M. L.

"A quadrat survey was conducted in October 2004 to measure the species and size distribution of plants at 10 GCE LTER sampling sites.  The quadrats were established as permanent plots at GCE sampling sites in October 2000 by placing wooden stakes at random locations across two nominal zones at each site, designated based on marsh structure (creekbank and high marsh).  Several new plots were also added in October 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 to replace those lost due to catastrophic wrack disturbance or creek bank erosion.  The plots were visually surveyed and the species, shoot height, and flowering status was recorded individually for each shoot over 10 cm in height present in each plot.  Observations from plots exhibiting signs of disturbance were noted in the data set.  This survey will be repeated annually to assess changes in plant distribution and biomass in relation to environmental changes documented by other GCE LTER monitoring efforts.",Steven C.

Most of the prairies had developed after being abandoned from agriculture, but none of the savannahs had been cultivated. The history of burning varied between sites. Insects were sampled via sweep-net sampling, pitfalls and ant plates throughout the growing season in each of 49 grassland fields and savannahs. In total, 89,596 individuals of 1,167 species were captured and enumerated. Body size was measured for a subset of grasshoppers collected.

"This project was designed to investigate the response of plant growth  and reproduction to short- and long-term variation in biotic and  abiotic environmental variables.  Several perennial taxa, including tree  (Juniperus monsperma and Pinus edulis), shrub (Larrea tridentata) and bunch grasses (Oryzopsis hymenoides (now Achnaterum hymenoides) and Sporobolus contractus)  species, were monitored at 1-3 sites differing in elevation and  topography as well as edaphic variables and annual precipitation.  The  sites represented optimal or marginal/transitional zones for particular  species.  Demographic measurements were made biannually, after the 'wet'  (fall) and 'dry' (spring) seasons.  For tree and shrub species,  estimates of growth and reproduction were based on branch demography,  with ten branch tips from 10-20 individuals per species per site  repeatedly measured from 1989-1993.   For J. monsperma, P. edulis and L. tridentata,  vegetative growth (i.e., branch growth) as well as reproduction were  monitored. Additional measurements included needle length for P. edulis and leaf production, leaf size and branchlet production for L. tridentata.  For grasses, basal diameter, leaf length and reproduction were monitored for 100 individuals per species per site.

"Most investigators studying grasslands have assumed that the low standing biomass of the SGS created a system with a low probability of carrying fire, and thus a minimal historical role of fire. Nonetheless, there are years with aboveground biomass equivalent to the mixed grass prairie, and a high frequency of lightening storms. Regardless of the historical role of fire in SGS, there are new questions regarding its utility in managing for the presence of the threatened mountain plover, which only nests in areas of low plant biomass. United States Forest Service, Pawnee National Grassland recently initiated a burning program in the mid 1990s to address questions about using fire to increase plover habitat; we have collected data on some of these plots to investigate the influence of fire on SGS vegetation.  Several datasets were created between 1999 and 2004 by SGS-LTER researchers, including measurements of shrub and cactus mortality rates, aboveground net primary production, amounts of litter and standing dead, and aboveground nitrogen dynamics in burned and control plots in the western section of the Pawnee National Grassland.",Dan Milchunas,urn:node:LTER,Milchunas,1999-06-01T00:00:00Z,,,,"uid=SGS\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org",a81311d938c326b0ad074c1be243e970,MD5,,Department of Rangeland Ecosystem Science,urn:node:LTER,https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/doi%3A10.6073%2FAA%2Fknb-lter-sgs.129.4,2012-06-26T15:47:08.285Z,2008-01-01T00:00:00Z,2011-11-17T00:00:00Z,,,-104.73055,,2003-09-30T00:00:00Z,,https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/doi%3A10.6073%2FAA%2Fknb-lter-sgs.129.4,eml://ecoinformatics.org/eml-2.1.0,METADATA,,,,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-sgs.129.4,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-sgs.129.4,Milchunas,,true,,,"fire ecology,disturbance,nitrogen,organic nitrogen",,,,,40.8575,,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-sgs.129.5,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-sgs.129.3,,,Dan Milchunas,,,,,,,,2008-01-01T00:00:00Z,,"public,uid=SGS\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org",,"urn:node:LTER,urn:node:CN",false,"2012-06-26T00:00:00Z,2012-06-26T00:00:00Z",,"uid=SGS,o=LTER,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org",,,,15361,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-sgs.129.4,,40.800278,,"uid=SGS,o=LTER,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org",,Monthly Nitrogen content of aboveground biomass on and off US Forest Service Burns,,2011-11-17T00:00:00Z,,-104.785835,"uid=SGS\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org"
"We use a retrospective approach to reconstruct the past distribution of fire in New England and to investigate the important drivers of this pattern across the period of European arrival to North America.  Our study sites are in New England, and range from pitch pine and oak forests of coastal Massachusetts, pine and hardwood forests of central Massachusetts, and northern hardwood and spruce fir forests of northern Massachusetts and Vermont.  We collected sediment profiles from 18 lakes across the study area to assess fossil charcoal and pollen abundance over the past 1000 years and including the time period of European arrival and settlement. Based on presettlement pollen composition, our study sites are divided into three vegetation types: 1) pitch pine and oak, 2) oak, pine, and hardwood, and 3) northern hardwoods.  The abundance of presettlement charcoal in these lakes is closely related to climate and the composition of surrounding vegetation.  Charcoal is most abundant in pitch pine forests and least common in northern hardwood and spruce forests.  Following the arrival of Europeans, charcoal abundance increases, at most sites substantially, and vegetation composition changed in a direction of either greater dominance by pitch pine or white pine, depending on whether the forests were located in the southern or northern part of New England. The major factor influencing the distribution of fire across New England is climate, which has a direct effect on the physical conditions conducive to fire ignition and spread and an indirect effect on fire through its control on the distribution of vegetation at this spatial scale.  We find evidence that other factors exert some control over local fire regimes as well including landforms and their impact on vegetation composition, firebreaks, and prevailing winds.  Native Americans likely influenced the local occurrence of fire, but their impact on regional fire regimes in New England is not apparent from this or other studies.   However, additional paleoecological, archaeological and historical work needs to be done to better address this question.  In contrast, Europeans had a dramatic effect on fire throughout the New England landscape, increasing its occurrence almost everywhere.",Tim Parshall,urn:node:LTER,"Parshall,Foster",,,,,"uid=HFR\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org",41001330cd6939fde59bb228af092f83,MD5,,,urn:node:LTER,https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/doi%3A10.6073%2FAA%2Fknb-lter-hfr.76.3,2012-06-26T15:37:19.903Z,2003-01-01T00:00:00Z,2006-03-14T00:00:00Z,,,-69.9,,,,https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/doi%3A10.6073%2FAA%2Fknb-lter-hfr.76.3,eml://ecoinformatics.org/eml-2.0.1,METADATA,,,,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-hfr.76.3,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-hfr.76.3,"Parshall,Foster",,true,,,"paleological,disturbance,fire,forest ecology,fossil charcoal,fossil pollen,human impacts,paleoecology,presettlement vegetation",,,,,42.0,,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-hfr.76.4,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-hfr.76.2,,,"Tim Parshall,David Foster",,,,,,,,2003-01-01T00:00:00Z,,"uid=HFR\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org,public",,"urn:node:LTER,urn:node:CN",false,"2012-06-26T00:00:00Z,2012-06-26T00:00:00Z",,"uid=HFR,o=LTER,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org",,,,11267,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-hfr.76.3,,41.3,,"uid=HFR,o=LTER,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org",,Long-term Vegetation Dynamics on the Massachusetts Coast,,2006-03-14T00:00:00Z,,-70.6,"uid=HFR\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org"

"Permanent plots are a powerful tool for understanding systems over the long term because of the rigorous quantification of patterns in a spatially refined way and because of the comparability of numerous variables measured in the same place. In 1998, 7 plots were surveyed into 3 forests in the study region of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES): Oregon Ridge Park (4 plots), Hillsdale Park (1 plot), and Leakin Park (2 plots). Plots were surveyed in to correct for slope and to achieve an accuracy of plot side length to within 0.5 cm. Plots are 1600 m2 with the exception of the Hillsdale plot which is 900 m2. The Hillsdale plot is smaller to fit within the confines of the forest patch. Sites were selected 1) to represent urban and non-urban forests, 2) away from obvious habitat boundaries or edges, 3) with consistent drainage lines within the plot, and 4) with at least 80 % continuous tree canopy. All vegetation layers were sampled in order to characterize the structure and composition of the plant community. A variety of sampling methods were used for the different layers but all layers were quantified with a high level of detail to minimize variation and to best characterize the plot.","M. L.

"The purpose of this experiment is to measure how adding nitrogen over a long time will affect the number of species, the type of species present, the amount of annual growth, and the change from year to year in the growth of each species in a plant community which is also relieved of grazing by large and small mammals. The experiment is being conducted within fields (A, B, C, and D) which were initially low in soil nutrients. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. There are 6 replicates of the 9 treatments in fields A, B, and C and 5 replicates in field D. The treatments were randomly assigned to the plots. In fields A, B, and C the plots are in 6 by 9 grids and are 4 by 4 meters in size with 1 meter aisles between plots. In field D the plots are 1.5 by 4 meters and are placed in a 3 by 17 grid.

"The goal of this study was to examine the population of insects in prairies and savannahs. Most of the prairies had developed after being abandoned from agriculture, but none of the savannahs had been cultivated. The history of burning varied between sites. Insects were sampled via sweep-net sampling, pitfalls and ant plates throughout the growing season in each of 49 grassland fields and savannahs. In total, 89,596 individuals of 1,167 species were captured and enumerated. Body size was measured for a subset of grasshoppers collected.

"Permanent plots are a powerful tool for understanding systems over the long term because of the rigorous quantification of patterns in a spatially refined way and because of the comparability of numerous variables measured in the same place. In 1998, 7 plots were surveyed into 3 forests in the study region of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES): Oregon Ridge Park (4 plots), Hillsdale Park (1 plot), and Leakin Park (2 plots). Plots were surveyed in to correct for slope and to achieve an accuracy of plot side length to within 0.5 cm. Plots are 1600 m2 with the exception of the Hillsdale plot which is 900 m2. The Hillsdale plot is smaller to fit within the confines of the forest patch. Sites were selected 1) to represent urban and non-urban forests, 2) away from obvious habitat boundaries or edges, 3) with consistent drainage lines within the plot, and 4) with at least 80 % continuous tree canopy.

"A quadrat survey was conducted in October 2008 to measure the species and size distribution of plants at 10 GCE LTER sampling sites. The quadrats were established as permanent plots at GCE sampling sites in October 2000 by placing wooden stakes at random locations across two nominal zones at each site, designated based on marsh structure (creekbank and high marsh). Several new plots were also added in October 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 to replace those lost due to catastrophic wrack disturbance or creek bank erosion. The plots were visually surveyed and the species, shoot height, and flowering status was recorded individually for each shoot over 10 cm in height present in each plot.

"The purpose of this experiment is to measure how initially disturbing an area and adding nitrogen over a long time will affect the number of species, the type of species present, the amount of annual growth, and the change from year to year in the growth of each species in a plant community which is also relieved of grazing by large and small mammals. This experiment is conducted within fields (A, B, and C) which were initially low in soil nutrients. The ground was disturbed by thoroughly disking the area prior to establishment of the experiment. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. There are six replicates of each treatment per field. The treatments were randomly assigned to plots of size 4 by 4 meters. The plots are in 6 plot by 9 plot grids with 1 meter aisles between plots. The plot grids are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. In the spring of 1992, subexperiments E097 and E098 were established. E097 is in fields A and C where randomly selected plots within each treatment no longer receive fertilizer. E098 is in field B where randomly selected plots within each treatment are burned. Note that the design of E002 is similar to E001 except E002 was thoroughly disked prior to establishment.",David Tilman,urn:node:LTER,Tilman,1982-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,"uid=CDR\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org",469271e1194a67941c65cb153f44127e,MD5,,,urn:node:LTER,https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/doi%3A10.6073%2FAA%2Fknb-lter-cdr.157002.123,2012-06-26T17:21:44.625Z,2012-06-14T00:00:00Z,2012-03-12T23:00:00Z,,,-93.16289,,2009-01-01T00:00:00Z,,https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/doi%3A10.6073%2FAA%2Fknb-lter-cdr.157002.123,eml://ecoinformatics.org/eml-2.1.0,METADATA,,,,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-cdr.157002.123,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-cdr.157002.123,Tilman,,true,,,"carbon,ecology,ecosystems,nitrogen,nutrients,soil,species",,,,,45.44138,,,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-cdr.157002.122,,,David Tilman,,,,,,,,2012-06-14T00:00:00Z,,"public,uid=CDR\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org",,"urn:node:LTER,urn:node:CN",false,"2012-06-26T00:00:00Z,2012-06-26T00:00:00Z",,"uid=CDR,o=LTER,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org",,,,24726,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-cdr.157002.123,,45.384865,,"uid=CDR,o=LTER,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org",,Soil carbon: Long-Term Nitrogen Deposition During Grassland Succession,,2012-03-12T23:00:00Z,,-93.22445,"uid=CDR\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org"

The abundance of bacteria in each sample was determined using an epifluorescence microscope by counting DAPI-stained cells retained on a 0.2Âµm polycarbonate filter. This study was part of the GCE-LTER hydrographic monitoring program, and will be repeated quarterly.",Robert E.

USGS Quadrangle - Cockeysville
Potential Hazards - Tall grass and field may present ticks
Establishment - November 1999
Datum of Station - about 404' above sea level
Equipment - J&S Tipping Bucket Rain Gague with HOBO Data Click Here to see a typical problem
History

    * 19 July 1999 Gauge is established.
    * 12 July 2002 Bird deterrant device installed on gauge. Device consists of wire fencing cut so that prongs stick up towards sky. Wire is then secured in a loop tight enough to stay on the funnel. Tape is wrapped around device to protect user and allow for easy removal. Height of device does not exceed 1.5cm above gauge lip.
    * 20 August 2002 Bird deterrant device determined to be ineffective and was removed. This determination was made after consecutive finds of bird feces while servicing. Plans have been made to tray another method. Calibration was checked, 150 mL with 16 tips. 

Panorama - This gauge is located in a open feild bounded by forest and roads.
Calibration Measurements - Calibration of this gauge should be preformed as described in the users manual. Each bucket should hold 8.24 mL of water before tipping. This should occur five consecutive times. Adjust calibration screws as needed.
Extreme Events No extreme events have been observed to present.
Winter Records - Rain gauge is not heated and is subject to freezing.
Accuracy - Data should be processed through a quality control algorithm before use.

"Permanent plots are a powerful tool for understanding systems over the long term because of the rigorous quantification of patterns in a spatially refined way and because of the comparability of numerous variables measured in the same place. In 1998, 7 plots were surveyed into 3 forests in the study region of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES): Oregon Ridge Park (4 plots), Hillsdale Park (1 plot), and Leakin Park (2 plots). Plots were surveyed in to correct for slope and to achieve an accuracy of plot side length to within 0.5 cm. Plots are 1600 m2 with the exception of the Hillsdale plot which is 900 m2. The Hillsdale plot is smaller to fit within the confines of the forest patch. Sites were selected 1) to represent urban and non-urban forests, 2) away from obvious habitat boundaries or edges, 3) with consistent drainage lines within the plot, and 4) with at least 80 % continuous tree canopy. All vegetation layers were sampled in order to characterize the structure and composition of the plant community. A variety of sampling methods were used for the different layers but all layers were quantified with a high level of detail to minimize variation and to best characterize the plot.","M. L.

"Biodiversity II (E120) is designed to determine how the number of plant species affects the dynamics of ecological processes at the population, community, and ecosystem levels. By experimentally manipulating the number of species and the kinds of species, the amount of plant growth and the change from year to year, that result can be examined. Plots are large (9m x 9m actively maintained) and well-replicated, allowing responses of plant pathogens, insect herbivores, seed predators, soil parameters, invasive plant species and other variables to also be studied. Plots were seeded in May 1994 to have 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 species, with roughly 30 replicates of each diversity level. The species composition of each plot was chosen by random draw from a pool of 18 grassland perennials that included four warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, four non-legume forbs, and two woody species. All species occur in monoculture allowing comparison of responses of each species in monoculture to combinations of these same species. The experiment was established in 1994 by the lead investigators David Tilman, Peter Reich, Johannes Knops, and David Wedin. Experiment 120 is similar to Experiment 123, but it uses larger plots to provide a large capacity for long-term subexperiments.",David Tilman,urn:node:LTER,Tilman,1996-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,"uid=CDR\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org",3e78a07cdddb1827ab3568ce555fc066,MD5,,,urn:node:LTER,https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/doi%3A10.6073%2FAA%2Fknb-lter-cdr.56120.123,2012-06-26T16:36:04.032Z,2012-06-14T00:00:00Z,2011-12-14T00:00:00Z,,,-93.16289,,2007-01-01T00:00:00Z,,https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/doi%3A10.6073%2FAA%2Fknb-lter-cdr.56120.123,eml://ecoinformatics.org/eml-2.1.0,METADATA,,,,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-cdr.56120.123,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-cdr.56120.123,Tilman,,true,,,"Biodiversity,Climatic Variation,Disturbance Patterns,Ecology,Ecosystem functioning,Fire Frequency,Long Term,Nitrogen limitation,Nutrient Budgets,Nutrient Cycles,Plant Competition,Primary Productivity,Successional dynamics,ammonium,ecology,ecosystems,forbs,nitrate,plant species,plants,soil,species",,,,,45.44138,,,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-cdr.56120.122,,,David Tilman,,,,,,,,2012-06-14T00:00:00Z,,"public,uid=CDR\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org",,"urn:node:LTER,urn:node:CN",false,"2012-06-26T00:00:00Z,2012-06-26T00:00:00Z",,"uid=CDR,o=LTER,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org",,,,63757,doi:10.6073/AA/knb-lter-cdr.56120.123,,45.384865,,"uid=CDR,o=LTER,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org",,Soil nitrate and ammonium: Biodiversity II:  Effects of Plant Biodiversity on Population and Ecosystem Processes,,2011-12-14T00:00:00Z,,-93.22445,"uid=CDR\,o=lter\,dc=ecoinformatics\,dc=org"

"This study seeks to understand changes in land use in Macon County North Carolina since first white settlement (~1820) as a response to social and economic forces. While the Southern Appalachian region as a whole experienced population growth between 1950 and 1990, this is a continuation of a pattern set early in the population history of the region, for example, population growth during the decade of 1820 exceeded 40%. The selection of Macon County is based on its now being identified as the most rapidly changing county in the Blue Ridge as well as the analytical importance of place to understanding human decision-making. Place determines both the particular dimensions of the experience humans are seeking (e.g., view, proximity to services, cost of construction) and serves as the basis for evaluating the long-run effects of land-use scenarios on the structure and function of ecosystems.

"Surface water samples were collected during low tide surveys near ten Georgia Coastal Ecosystem LTER sampling sites in October, 2001. Unfiltered subsamples were immediately preserved with buffered formalin and refrigerated for transport to the laboratory. The abundance of bacteria in each sample was determined using an epifluorescence microscope by counting DAPI-stained cells retained on a 0.2µm polycarbonate filter.

"A quadrat survey was conducted in October 2005 to measure the species and size distribution of plants at 10 GCE LTER sampling sites.  The quadrats were established as permanent plots at GCE sampling sites in October 2000 by placing wooden stakes at random locations across two nominal zones at each site, designated based on marsh structure (creekbank and high marsh).  Several new plots were also added in October 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 to replace those lost due to catastrophic wrack disturbance or creek bank erosion.  The plots were visually surveyed and the species, shoot height, and flowering status was recorded individually for each shoot over 10 cm in height present in each plot.  Observations from plots exhibiting signs of disturbance were noted in the data set.  This survey will be repeated annually to assess changes in plant distribution and biomass in relation to environmental changes documented by other GCE LTER monitoring efforts.",Steven C.
