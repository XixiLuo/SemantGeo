Mr. Ashby: 
The best idea is to keep track of your project progress on the wiki page of our github project for you.

As a test, try to create a wiki page at:
https://github.com/apseyed/SemantGeo/wiki

Slides on Gaz and Envo ontology:
http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/ontology/FOGI-WS/presentations/Norman-Morrison.pdf

Website for the GAZ project: (#9 talks about the different relationships, think about how these might be used in search)
http://gensc.org/gc_wiki/index.php/GAZ_Project

Paper on using Gazateers and other knowledge sources for search:
http://www.ai.sri.com/pubs/files/993.pdf

then go down to:
http://apseyed.wordpress.com/2013/01/03/dataone-symlinking-current-status/#three

and read about 
Geospatial Example: Partonomic/Containment Example (from GAZ ontology) and
Geospatial Example: Geo Feature Instance->Type Example (from ENVO ontology)

Note that in SemantEco we have for each observation data record, we have lat/long, county code, and state, but we don't have a way to access and search data relative to descriptive geospatial features within county, state, etc., and we don't have modeling of relationships like "contained in", "tributary of", etc.

Free GIS programs:
There are free software programs with similar functions, such as GRASS GIS:
http://grass.osgeo.org/ and Quantum GIS: http://www.qgis.org/
